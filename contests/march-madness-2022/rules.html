					<h1>2022 CouchGM March Madness Bracket Contest</h1>
					<p><i>Beat the CouchGM NCAA Men’s Basketball Predictor to win a share of a $100 cash prize!</i></p>
					<p><b>1. The Contest</b>. The 2022 CouchGM March Madness Bracket Contest (“the Contest”) is a challenge to beat the CouchGM NCAA Men’s Basketball Predictor (“the Model”) in a bracket competition. All eligible entrants, if any, who beat the Model will earn a share of a cash prize.</p>
					<p><b>2. Eligibility</b>. Entrants will be eligible to participate in the Contest once they have completed each of the entrance requirements set forth below. Eligibility is limited to one (1) bracket submission per person.</p>
					<p><b>3. How to Enter</b>. Complete each of the following requirements to enter the Contest</p>
					<p style="margin-left: 20px">1. Like/follow at least one of the CouchGM social media pages on <a href="https://www.facebook.com/CouchGMSports/">Facebook</a>, <a href="https://www.twitter.com/CouchGMSports/">Twitter</a>, and/or <a href="https://www.instagram.com/CouchGMSports/">Instagram</a>.</p>
					<p style="margin-left: 20px">2. Share CouchGM's social media post promoting the Contest on at least one of Facebook, Twitter, and/or Instagram.</p>
					<p style="margin-left: 20px">3. Send proof of like/follow (requirement 1) and of share (requirement 2) to contact@couchgm.com.</p>
					<p style="margin-left: 20px">4. Join the Contest using the invitation link that will be shared with you following verification of requirements 1-3. The Contest will be hosted on CBS, ESPN, or another major bracket challenge provider (“the Host”). An account with the Host will be required to enter.</p>
					<p><b>4. Contest Period</b>. The Contest will open at the reveal of the 2022 NCAA men’s basketball tournament bracket on Sunday March 13, 2022 and will conclude with the completion of the national championship game on Monday April 4, 2022. Brackets must be submitted before tip-off of the first game of the 2022 NCAA Men’s Basketball tournament, as controlled by the Host.</p>
					<p><b>5. Prize</b>. A total prize of $100 USD (“the Prize”) will be offered. The Prize will be divided into 3 categories as follows:</p>
					<p style="margin-left: 20px"><b><u>Prize 1</u></b>: 25% of the Prize ($25) will be awarded to the Contest’s overall winner (the entrant with the most points). In the event of a tie, the prize will be divided evenly between tied eligible entrants.</p>
					<p style="margin-left: 20px"><b><u>Prize 2</u></b>: 25% of the Prize ($25) will be awarded to the entrant with the most correct picks. In the event of a tie, the prize will be divided evenly between tied eligible entrants.</p>
					<p style="margin-left: 20px"><b><u>Prize 3</u></b>: 50% of the Prize ($50) will be divided evenly between all eligible entrants that score more points OR make more correct picks than the Model. Being tied with the Model will not be sufficient. To earn a portion of Prize 3, the entrant must exceed the model in either total points or correct picks.</p>
					<p>A single eligible entrant may earn a prize in more than one category. For example, if the same eligible entrant has both the most points and the most correct picks, that entrant will earn both Prize 1 and Prize 2. The entrant(s) with the most correct points and picks will also be included in Prize 3. The maximum possible prize a single entrant can earn is $100 USD.</p>
					<p>The Model will be considered an eligible entrant and may win Prize 1 or Prize 2 if it has the most points or most correct picks. If there are no eligible entrants with more points or picks than the Model, the entirety of Prize 3 will be awarded to the Model.</p>
					<p><b>6. Odds</b>. The odds of winning depend on the number of eligible entries received, and the prize amounts awarded depend on the number of eligible entrants that earn more points and/or make more correct picks than the Model</p>
					<p><b>7. Winners</b>. Winners will be notified within forty-eight (48) hours from the completion of the national championship game and prize payment, which will be made via Venmo, Google Pay, or other electronic transfer service, will be arranged. In the event that the winner(s) can not be reached or does not respond within seventy-two (72) hours from the time of notification, the winnings may be forfeited.</p>
					<p>After completion of the first NCAA tournament game, the Contest results, including total points, picks, and winnings ($), can be viewed at the CouchGM website.</p>
					<p><b>8. Privacy</b>. Information submitted with an entry is subject to the CouchGM Privacy Policy, which can be found on the CouchGM website by clicking <a href="/privacy/index.html">here</a>.</p>
