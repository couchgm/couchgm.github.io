					<h1>Meet the CouchGM Team</h1>
					<p>CouchGM was born from family discussions that took place on the couch while watching sports. Discussions evolved to text messages and then to this site, dedicated to those couch discussions.</p>

					<h1>Zach Hales</h1>
					<h2>Founder, CEO & CouchGM</h2>
					<p>Medical Device Engineer by day, CouchGM by night! My biggest interests have always been science and sports. I tell my wife that in an alternate reality I would've become a sports statistician. After creating shot charts and tracking stats for my own pick-up basketball games for a the last year, I decided something more official needed to be done and here I am living out that alternate reality part-time. I like to bring together the statistical side and the fan side of me together in an analytical approach to sports. I'm a big fan of the Phoenix Suns, Arizona Cardinals, Arizona Wildcats, Arizona Diamondbacks, and Boston Red Sox, in that order. Also a washed-up high school volleyball star.</p>

					<h2>CFO & Assistant CouchGM</h2>

					<h1>Terry Hales</h1>
					<h2>CLO & Assistant CouchGM</h2>
					<p>I was a journalism major at the University of Arizona prior to transferring to BYU and changing my major to poli sci. After completing a BA, I decided to take a year off prior to attending law school. Well, I joined the PGA of America and the year off eventually lasted 22 years. I was a quasi-media member when I co-hosted an AM radio drive-time golf talk show in Tucson, AZ and published about 100 golf related articles in a variety of local and regional publications. Also produced a 46-minute golf instruction video entitled “From Tee to Green: YOUR Perfect Swing.” Former member of the Advisory Board of the Sports Management Program at York College of Pennsylvania. Current Attorney. Grew up a fan of the Philadelphia 76ers, Los Angeles Dodgers and Oakland Raiders but now a fan of the Phoenix Suns, Arizona Diamondbacks and Arizona Cardinals.</p>
