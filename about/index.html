					<h1>Meet the CouchGM Team</h1>
					<p>CouchGM started as family discussions on the couch while watching sports. Discussions evolved to text messages and then to this site, dedicated to those couch discussions.</p>
					<p>Our goal is to encourage statistics-based discussions about your favorite sports teams, players, and topics. We try to objectively answer sports-related questions. To that end, we've developed predictive models, based on statistics and recent history, that drive our analysis. We also post on our blog discussions and opinions on a variety of other sports-topics.</p>

					<h1>Zach Hales</h1>
					<h2>Founder, CEO & CouchGM</h2>
					<p>Medical Device Engineer by day, CouchGM by night! My biggest interests have always been science and sports. I tell my wife that in an alternate reality I would've become a sports statistician. After creating shot charts and tracking stats for my own pick-up basketball games for the last year, I decided something more official needed to be done and here I am living out that alternate reality part-time. I like to bring together the statistical side and the fan side of me together in an analytical approach to sports. I'm a big fan of the Phoenix Suns, Arizona Cardinals, Arizona Wildcats, Arizona Diamondbacks, and Boston Red Sox, in that order. Also a washed-up high school volleyball star.</p>
					<div></div>
					<h1>Andrew Hales</h1>
					<h2>CFO & Assistant CouchGM</h2>
					<p>Like so many of us, the pinnacle of my sports career was in high school as the 2-time state runner-up in volleyball. I am a big basketball fan and tried to get a chance in college, but there's just too many 6 foot tall, 3&(no)D white guys so that was the end of that dream. I'm a CPA and love spreadsheets and numbers. I love watching sports, talking strategies, and finding the data to support my positions. My advanced analytics do come in handy in fantasy leagues! CouchGM is my outlet to explain who is the GOAT (if you're willing to consider literally anything other than just rings) and to try to shine a light on players or teams that don't get the credit they deserve. I cheer for the Arizona pro sports teams and the superior Arizona college (Bear Down).</p>

					<!--<h1>Riley Hales</h1>
					<h2>CTO</h2>
					<div></div>-->
					<h1>Terry Hales</h1>
					<h2>CLO & Assistant CouchGM</h2>
					<p>I was a journalism major at the University of Arizona prior to transferring to BYU and changing my major to poli sci. After completing a BA, I decided to take a year off prior to attending law school. Well, I joined the PGA of America and the year off eventually lasted 22 years. I was a quasi-media member when I co-hosted an AM radio drive-time golf talk show in Tucson, AZ and published about 100 golf related articles in a variety of local and regional publications. Also produced a 46-minute golf instruction video entitled “From Tee to Green: YOUR Perfect Swing.” Former member of the Advisory Board of the Sports Management Program at York College of Pennsylvania. Current Attorney. Grew up a fan of the Philadelphia 76ers, Los Angeles Dodgers and Oakland Raiders but now a fan of the Phoenix Suns, Arizona Diamondbacks and Arizona Cardinals.</p>
