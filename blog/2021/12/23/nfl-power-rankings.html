					<h1>NFL Power Rankings December 23, 2021</h1>
					<span>By Terry Hales, Assistant CouchGM</span>
					<p><i>CouchGM’s weekly NFL power rankings, in order of descending championship probability. Power rankings will be published weekly on Tuesdays with each week’s update to the model. Listed below is each team's current Super Bowl probability, change in ranking vs last week, and last week’s Super Bowl probability.</i></p>

					<p>This week’s schedule of games features four spotlight matchups that could either shake up the CouchGM Power Rankings or provide further clarity as to who the top dogs really are. These start with the #1 New England Patriots who continue to hold the CouchCM #1 spot. They host the #5 Buffalo Bills this Sunday in <b>the marquee matchup of the week.</b> A lot of the future of the CouchGM Rankings for the remainder of the season will be decided by the outcome of that game. But more importantly for the Bills, they currently are the last AFC Wildcard in a tie-breaker over the Baltimore Ravens so a Bills loss to the Patriots will knock the Bills out of the AFC playoff picture notwithstanding their strong offensive and defensive ratings that have them in the CouchGM top-5.</p>
					<p>The current NFC #1 seed Green Bay Packers remain in the CouchGM #2 spot. This week they host the playoff longshot Cleveland Browns and next week they host the Minnesota Vikings. Look for the Pack to virtually eliminate the Browns this week and then deal the Vikings a serious body blow next week. They close at the suddenly competitive Detroit Lions. Look for the Packers to finish strong and possibly move up to CouchGM #1.</p>
					<p>A huge jump this week for the Kansas City Chiefs. They currently hold the #1 seed in the AFC and are riding a league-best 7-game winning streak. (The second best streak is the Miami Dolphins’ 6-game streak. No other team in the league has a streak >3 games.) Look for the Chiefs’ streak to continue this week at home against the Steelers.</p>
					<p>The eye test tells me the Super Bowl will be the Packers and the Chiefs. The CouchGM Power Rankings agrees.</p>

					<p>The CouchGM Super Bowl Predictor has the 14 playoff teams in the top 15 of this week’s Power Rankings. The one outlier is the Denver Broncos who currently sit at #13 in the AFC standings. The Broncos’ final three games are at the Raiders, at the Chargers and home against the Chiefs. That’s a tough row to hoe and they could win all three and still miss the playoffs. Also, Teddy Bridgewater is still in the concussion protocol. Not a particularly rosy outlook for the outlier Broncos.</p>
					<p>It is hard to not forecast yet another late season collapse for the Arizona Cardinals. It remains somewhat surprising that Cardinals opponents don’t run the ball >60% of the time given their poor defense against the run. This week the CouchGM #8 Cardinals host Jonathan Taylor (1,508 rushing yards this year) and the CouchGM #6 Indianapolis Colts. The Colts need the win in their pursuit of the AFC South division-leading Tennessee Titans. The Cardinals need the win to remain in the NFC West lead. The Christmas night game is <b>the second spotlight matchup of the week.</b></p>
					<p><b>The third spotlight matchup of the week</b> is the #7 Los Angeles Rams at the #14 Minnesota Vikings. Both teams need this win to improve their playoff position; the Rams in their pursuit of the Cardinals in the NFC West and the Vikings as they attempt to maintain their tenuous hold on  the final NFC Wildcard spot.</p>

					<p>All of these teams need a lot of help to get into the playoffs. The Carolina Panthers really belong in the next grouping but, like the Bills and Broncos, their record is worse than their stats.</p>
					<p>The CouchGM #16 New Orleans Saints play at the hot CouchGM #23 Miami Dolphins on Monday night in <b>the final spotlight matchup of the week.</b> Either the Saints or the Dolphins will walk off that field all but eliminated from the playoffs. A Saints win seems improbable given the ugly but effective 9-0 win last week in Tampa and the recent strong play from the Fish.</p>
